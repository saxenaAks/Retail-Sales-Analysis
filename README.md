It involves data collection, data processing using Azure Databricks and PySpark, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and providing actionable insights and recommendations.

## Project Structure

- `historical_sales_analysis.py`: Python script containing the entire project code.
- `historical-sales-data.zip`: Dataset downloaded from Kaggle.
- `sales_analysis_report.pdf`: Detailed report containing insights and recommendations.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Kaggle API
- Azure Databricks
- PySpark
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/historical-sales-analysis.git
   ```

2. Install the required packages:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the Kaggle dataset:
   - Create a Kaggle account and obtain API credentials.
   - Update `historical_sales_analysis.py` with your Kaggle username and API key.
   - Run the script to download and extract the dataset.

## Usage

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed.
2. Run `python historical_sales_analysis.py` to execute the project.
3. The script will download the dataset, perform data processing, EDA, and generate insights and recommendations.
4. Check the generated report `sales_analysis_report.pdf` for detailed analysis and actionable insights.

## Additional Notes

- Modify the script as needed for custom analysis or additional features.
- Experiment with different data processing techniques and algorithms for further insights.
- Incorporate feedback and suggestions from stakeholders to improve sales strategies and inventory management.
